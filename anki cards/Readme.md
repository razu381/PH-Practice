Generate Anki card back using html

The output should be structured as an Anki flashcard, including:

An HTML-formatted answer inside a <div> with this CSS:

font-family: sans-serif;

padding: 10px;

Any code blocks must be wrapped in <pre><code>, background color for <pre> should be #2c3e50; and styled with:

color: white;

padding: 10px 20px;

Code must wrap to the next line (do not use horizontal scrolling)

Split multiple code examples into separate blocks, each with a label or explanation above it

Keep answers beginner-friendly but complete, with at least 2â€“4 code examples if relevant

Use this format every time. Do not make any part of the code or answer responsive.
