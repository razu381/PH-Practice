"Question","Answer"
"What's the difference between data, information, and a database?","Data are raw facts; information is processed data with meaning; a database is an organized collection of data."
"What is a DBMS (Database Management System) and why is it used?","A DBMS is software that allows users to define, create, maintain, and control access to the database. It provides a structured way to manage and interact with data."
"Explain the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases.","SQL databases are relational, table-based, and use structured query language (SQL). NoSQL databases are non-relational, document/key-value/graph-based, and offer more flexible schemas for unstructured data."
"What are the different types of database models? Briefly explain the Relational Model.","Database models include Hierarchical, Network, Relational, Object-Oriented, and NoSQL models. The Relational Model organizes data into tables (relations) with rows (tuples) and columns (attributes), connected by common fields."
"What is a table/relation in a database? Describe its fundamental components.","A table (or relation) is a collection of related data organized in rows and columns. Its components are rows (records/tuples) representing individual entities, and columns (fields/attributes) representing specific characteristics of those entities."
"What are the ACID properties in the context of database transactions?","ACID stands for Atomicity (all or nothing), Consistency (valid state before and after), Isolation (concurrent transactions don't interfere), and Durability (committed changes are permanent)."
"What is a 'key' in a database? Why are they important?","A key is an attribute or set of attributes used to uniquely identify a record in a table, or to establish relationships between tables. They ensure data integrity and enable efficient data retrieval."
"Explain the difference between a Candidate Key, Primary Key, and Super Key.","A Super Key is any set of attributes that uniquely identifies a record. A Candidate Key is a minimal Super Key (no redundant attributes). A Primary Key is a Candidate Key chosen by the database designer to uniquely identify records in a table."
"What is an Alternate Key?","An Alternate Key is a Candidate Key that is not chosen as the Primary Key."
"What is a Composite Key and when would you use one?","A Composite Key is a Primary Key composed of two or more attributes. It's used when no single attribute can uniquely identify a record."
"What is a Foreign Key? How does it establish relationships between tables?","A Foreign Key is a column (or set of columns) in one table that refers to the Primary Key in another table. It establishes a link or relationship between two tables, enforcing referential integrity."
"Explain different types of relationships between tables (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many) and give examples.","One-to-one (e.g., Person to Passport), One-to-many (e.g., Department to Employees), Many-to-many (e.g., Students to Courses, typically resolved with a junction table)."
"What is relationship cardinality?","Relationship cardinality defines the number of instances of one entity that can be associated with the number of instances of another entity (e.g., one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)."
"What are the general techniques/steps involved in designing a database?","Common steps include requirements gathering, conceptual design (ER model), logical design (mapping to relational model), physical design (storage details), and implementation."
"What is database normalization? What are the benefits of normalization?","Normalization is the process of organizing the columns and tables of a relational database to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity. Benefits include less data redundancy, better data consistency, and easier data maintenance."
"Explain the different Normal Forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF).","1NF: Each column contains atomic (indivisible) values. 2NF: Is in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the Primary Key. 3NF: Is in 2NF and has no transitive dependencies (non-key attributes depend only on the Primary Key, not on other non-key attributes)."
"What is denormalization and when might you consider it?","Denormalization is the process of intentionally introducing redundancy into a database to improve query performance. It's considered when read performance is critical and the costs of redundancy (like update anomalies) are acceptable."
"Imagine you're designing a database for an e-commerce platform. What tables would you create and how would you relate them? Identify primary and foreign keys.","Potential tables: Users (PK: UserID), Products (PK: ProductID), Orders (PK: OrderID, FK: UserID), OrderItems (PK: OrderItemID, FKs: OrderID, ProductID), Categories (PK: CategoryID), etc. Relationships would be established using Foreign Keys."
"How would you handle a many-to-many relationship in a database? Provide an example.","A many-to-many relationship is typically resolved by creating a new, intermediary (or junction/associative) table that contains the Primary Keys of the two tables involved in the relationship as Foreign Keys. Example: Students and Courses are many-to-many. Create an 'Enrollments' table with StudentID and CourseID as Foreign Keys (and often a composite primary key)."
